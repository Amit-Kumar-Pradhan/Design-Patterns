# Singleton Design Pattern:
* Singleton is the pattern you need when you want to allow only one object to be created for a class.

Problem:
-----------
* It is an object oriented way of providing global variables.
* Borg: Unlike singleton, Borg allows multiple object instance but they share same state which means they have same attribute values in all objects.

Scenario:
----------
* Let's take the example of information cache that need to be shared by various element of your software system.

Solution:
---------
* All module in python act as singleton.
* Borg Design Pattern: It is a computer networking acronyms and there spelled out version.
