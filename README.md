# Design-Patterns:
* Design patterns are well known solutions to recurring problems.
* It is widely accepted by the software development community.

# Why to use?:
* You no need to reinvent the wheel when there is solution.
* It basically systematic reuse of design ideas which will help to lower the cost and provide higher quality.

# Founder of deisgn patter:
Christopher Alexander

# Characteristics:
* It is language neutral.
* Dynamic: You can revise design pattern whenever there is a need.
* It is always incomplete by design to promote customization.

# Types of Design Patters:
There are 3 types of design pattern
1. Creational
2. Structural
3. Behavioral

1. Creational Design Pattern:
Use:
------
* It is useful for creation of object systematically.

Benefits:
-----------
* It provides more flexibility.

ex: Difference types of object can be create from same class when you use creational pattern.

2. Structural Pattern:
Use:
-----
* Establish relationships between software components and particular settings and configuration.

Goal:
------
Accomplish both functional and non-functional requirements.

    Functional Requirements:
    -------------------------
    Basically it includes what the software does.

    Non Functional Requirements:
    ----------------------------
    1. How well it completes it's job.
    2. How fast or slow.

* Different goals have different structures.

3. Behavioral Pattern:
Use:
------
* It is the best practices of object interaction.
* Accomplish both functional and non-functional goals.

Focus:
------
* Protocols between these objects to accomplish a common goal.
* Interfaces are common across creational, structural and environmental patterns.

Understanding Of Pattern Concepts:
-----------------------------------
* Participants:
---------------
* classes involves to form design patterns.
* They play necessary roles to accomplish goal of design pattern.


Quality Attribute:
----------------------
* This refer to non functional requirements.
    -> Usability
    -> Modifiability
    -> Reliability
    -> Performance and more
* It has effect on entire software architectural solution.
