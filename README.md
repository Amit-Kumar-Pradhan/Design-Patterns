# Design-Patterns:
* Design patterns are well known solutions to recurring problems.
* It is widely accepted by the software development community.

# Why to use?:
* You no need to reinvent the wheel when there is solution.
* It basically systematic reuse of design ideas which will help to lower the cost and provide higher quality.

# Founder of deisgn patter:
Christopher Alexander

# Characteristics:
* It is language neutral.
* Dynamic: You can revise design pattern whenever there is a need.
* It is always incomplete by design to promote customization.

# Types of Design Patters:
There are 3 types of design pattern
1. Creational
2. Structural
3. Behavioral

Understanding Of Pattern Concepts:
-----------------------------------
* Participants:
---------------
* classes involves to form design patterns.
* They play necessary roles to accomplish goal of design pattern.


Quality Attribute:
----------------------
* This refer to non functional requirements.
    -> Usability
    -> Modifiability
    -> Reliability
    -> Performance and more
* It has effect on entire software architectural solution.

Forces:
----------
* This consist of various  factor or trade offs to consider.
    1. Manifests in quality attribiutes
    2. Unintended consequences

** Note **
----------
* Knowing when to use a design pattern and when not to is crucial because they can cause more problem to solve something.

Working with pattern language:
------------------------------
* This is something which is similar to learning new language.
* It consists of 
    1. Name
    2. Content
    3. Problem
    4. Solution
    5. Related Patterns

1. Name:
* It captures the gist and become the part of vocabulary.
* It should be meaningful and momorable.

2. Context:
* It provides a scenario in which we should use the pattern.
* It also provide more insights on when or where to use the pattern.

3. Problem:
* It describes a design challenge a pattern is addressing.

4. Solution:
* The solution part specisies the pattern itself.
* Patterns are specifies in terms of there
    * Structure -> Relationship
    * Behavior -> Interaction

5. Related Pattern:
* Lists other patterns
* Which can be used together.
* It is similar but different.
