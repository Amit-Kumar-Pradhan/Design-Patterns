# Decorator Design Pattern
* It is a structural design pattern that allows user to add new features to existing object without changing there structures.
* Python makes implementing the decorator pattern one step forward due to its inbuilt language feature.

Problem:
----------
* Add additional feature to an existing object dynamically without using sub classing.

Scenario:
---------
* Start with a function displaying 'Hello World!' message. Need to make the text more fancier by decorating the text <blink>Hello World!</blink>.

Solution:
---------
* Functions are object in python and we can add additional feature to these functions using the built in decorator in python.
* Pattern such as adapter, composite, startegy are related to the decorator pattern.
